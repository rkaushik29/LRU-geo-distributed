The first line specifies the number of servers (M), clients (N) and requests sent by the clients (R).
- Please limit (M <= 10) and (N <= (M/2)) for the best results and smooth running, since the project runs on a local system.

The following lines specify server and client details. x1 y1 represent geographical co-ordinates of servers and clients.

Client requests are specified with the client ID, request name, and data to request.
- The data used for this project is simple and consists of characters from 'A' to 'Z' (Uppercase only!) for demo purposes. Ideally, it could be any data.
